## Day-by-Day Curriculum

### Phase 1: Foundations

#### Day 1: Agentic AI - Core Concepts & Design Patterns
**Partner:** DeepLearning.AI

The foundational mental model for agentic AI. Introduces the **OBSERVE → THINK → ACT → REFLECT** loop that powers all autonomous agents. Unlike traditional chatbots that respond once, agents iterate in loops—gathering information, reasoning about actions, executing them, and evaluating results until the task is complete.

**Key concepts:** Agent loops, tool use, self-reflection, iteration limits

---

#### Day 2: Structured Outputs & Function Calling
**Partner:** OpenAI / DeepLearning.AI

The mechanism that enables agents to ACT. Structured outputs guarantee valid JSON from LLMs, eliminating parsing failures. Function calling lets models express intent to use tools while your code controls execution. This separation is critical for safe, auditable AI systems.

**Key concepts:** JSON Schema, tool definitions, parallel tool calls, Pydantic integration

---

#### Day 3: Building an Agent from Scratch
**Partner:** DeepLearning.AI

Implementing a basic agent loop with tool calling—without any frameworks. Understanding the raw mechanics of how agents work: the message flow, tool execution loop, and state management. This foundation makes framework usage more intuitive.

**Key concepts:** Message history, tool call loop, state management, error handling

---

#### Day 4: The ReAct Pattern - Reasoning + Acting
**Partner:** DeepLearning.AI

The foundational paper that defined modern agentic AI. ReAct interleaves **reasoning traces** (thoughts) with **actions** (tool calls), creating explainable agents. Thoughts help the model plan, track progress, and handle exceptions without affecting the environment.

**Key concepts:** Thought-action-observation loop, chain-of-thought, grounded reasoning

---

#### Day 5: Reflection & Self-Improvement Patterns
**Partner:** IBM / Coursera

Agents that critique and improve their own outputs. The REFLECT phase enables self-correction—agents evaluate their work, identify issues, and iterate. This pattern is essential for tasks requiring quality assurance, like code generation and writing.

**Key concepts:** Self-critique, iterative refinement, quality thresholds, Reflexion pattern

---

### Phase 2: Agent Frameworks

#### Day 6: LangChain - Functions, Tools & Agents
